# StudyAbroadHub 

A web application designed to help students find top spots for food, nightlife, and sightseeing in major study abroad cities. 

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project was created to blend functionality and visual appeal for students looking for reliable, curated recommendations while abroad.

## Features
- Mobile-responsive UI using Bootstrap
- Curated city guides with food, activities, and picture-worthy spots

## Why We Built It
